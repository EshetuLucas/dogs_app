#  All api related codes goes here 

### You can add a new api layer like the code below 
1. Create a new folder (dogs_api)
2. Create a new file under a created folder (get_apis.dart)
   --- If you create the file as get_apis.dart you should only use the file 
       for getting data from the get endpoint. 
   --- If you create the file as post_apis.dart you should only use the file 
       to post data to the server using post endpoint. The same goes for put, patch and delete.
